## How to run
It is important for now to run using the `python` interpreter.  It embeds an `IPython` console so if run from `IPython` or from somewhere were the `IPyton Qt Widget` is already running an error will be produced. See this [Multiple incompatible subclass instances of InProcessInteractiveShell](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20243754/multiple-incompatible-subclass-instances-of-interactiveshellembed-are-being-crea)vv

```
python pandapower_gui.py
```

running it with 
```
ipyton pandapower_gui.py
```

will generate an error as described above
